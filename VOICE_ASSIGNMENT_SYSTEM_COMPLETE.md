## üéõÔ∏è User Interface Components

### **Voice Assignment Display**
```python
voice_assignments_display = gr.Textbox(
    label="Auto-Assigned Voices (JSON - Editable)",
    lines=8,
    interactive=True,
    info="Shows automatically assigned voices for each language. You can edit these assignments."
)
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Voice Assignment Manager Class**
```python
class VoiceAssignmentManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.voice_assignments_file = "voice_assignments.json"
        self.custom_voice_config_file = "custom_voice_mapping.json"
        self.custom_voices_dir = Path("custom_voices")
        self.available_voices = self._load_available_voices()
    
    def auto_assign_voices(self, language_codes: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]:
        """Automatically assign voices based on priority logic."""
        # Priority: Custom Mapping > Custom Upload > Gemini > Edge > Kokoro
    
    def save_voice_assignments(self, voice_map: Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]):
        """Save voice assignments to JSON file."""
```

### **Available Voices Database**
```python
available_voices = {
    "gemini": {
        "hi-IN": ["hi_madhur", "hi_female", "hi_male"],
        "en-US": ["en_us_female", "en_us_male"],
        "es-US": ["es_us_female", "es_us_male"],
        # ... more languages
    },
    "edge": {
        "ar-EG": ["ar-EG-SalmaNeural", "ar-EG-ShakirNeural"],
        "de-DE": ["de-DE-AmalaNeural", "de-DE-ConradNeural", "de-DE-KatjaNeural"],
        "es-US": ["es-US-AlonsoNeural", "es-US-PalomaNeural"],
        # ... comprehensive voice library
    },
    "kokoro": {
        "ja-JP": ["af_heart", "af_bella", "af_sarah", "am_adam", "am_michael"],
        "en-US": ["af_heart", "af_bella", "af_sarah", "am_adam", "am_michael"],
        # ... supported languages
    }
}
```

### **Voice Assignment Structure**
```python
voice_map = {
    "hi-IN": {
        "engine": "gemini",
        "voice": "hi_madhur",
        "source": "custom_mapping"
    },
    "es-US": {
        "engine": "edge", 
        "voice": "es-US-AlonsoNeural",
        "source": "auto_edge"
    },
    "ja-JP": {
        "engine": "kokoro",
        "voice": "af_heart",
        "source": "auto_kokoro"
    }
}
```

## üìä Assignment Priority Logic

### **1. Custom Mapping (Highest Priority)**
- Checks `custom_voice_mapping.json` for user preferences
- Format: `{"hi-IN": {"engine": "gemini", "voice": "hi_madhur"}}`
- Overrides all automatic assignments

### **2. Custom Upload**
- Checks for uploaded voice files in `custom_voices/`
- Format: `[language_code]_custom.wav`
- Used when no engine supports the language

### **3. Gemini TTS (Primary Auto-Assignment)**
- First choice for automatic assignment
- High-quality voices with language-specific optimization
- Supports major languages with multiple voice options

### **4. Edge TTS (Secondary Auto-Assignment)**
- Comprehensive voice library with neural voices
- Covers most languages with multiple voice options
- Reliable fallback for unsupported Gemini languages

### **5. Kokoro TTS (Tertiary Auto-Assignment)**
- High-quality voices for supported languages
- Primarily Japanese and English
- Excellent voice quality for supported languages

### **6. Voice Not Found**
- Assigned when no engine supports the language
- Prompts user to upload custom voice
- Clearly marked in the UI for user action

## üöÄ Integration with Multi-Language Pipeline

### **Automatic Integration**
```python
# After successful translation
successfully_translated_languages = []
for lang_code, lang_name, _ in all_languages:
    json_file = f"translations/transcript_{lang_code}.json"
    if os.path.exists(json_file):
        successfully_translated_languages.append(lang_code)

# Auto-assign voices
voice_manager = VoiceAssignmentManager()
voice_map = voice_manager.auto_assign_voices(successfully_translated_languages)
voice_manager.save_voice_assignments(voice_map)
```

### **UI Integration**
- Voice assignments appear automatically after translation
- Editable JSON display for manual adjustments
- Management buttons for voice operations
- Custom upload for missing voices

## üìÅ File Structure

### **Configuration Files**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ voice_assignments.json          # Current session voice assignments
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_voice_mapping.json       # User preferences and overrides
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_voices/                  # Custom uploaded voice files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hi-IN_custom.wav
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es-US_custom.wav
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### **Voice Assignment JSON Format**
```json
{
  "hi-IN": {
    "engine": "gemini",
    "voice": "hi_madhur",
    "source": "custom_mapping"
  },
  "es-US": {
    "engine": "edge",
    "voice": "es-US-AlonsoNeural", 
    "source": "auto_edge"
  },
  "ja-JP": {
    "engine": "kokoro",
    "voice": "af_heart",
    "source": "auto_kokoro"
  }
}
```

### **Custom Voice Mapping Format**
```json
{
  "hi-IN": {
    "engine": "gemini",
    "voice": "hi_madhur"
  },
  "es-US": {
    "engine": "edge",
    "voice": "es-US-AlvaroNeural"
  },
  "ja-JP": {
    "engine": "kokoro",
    "voice": "af_heart"
  }
}
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Automatic Assignment**
1. User translates to Hindi, Spanish, Japanese

   - Japanese: `kokoro:af_heart` (custom mapping)
3. Assignments saved to `voice_assignments.json`
4. User can edit assignments in the UI

### **Example 2: Custom Voice Upload**
1. User translates to a language with "Voice Not Found"
2. System prompts for custom voice upload
3. User uploads `custom_voice.wav` for the language
4. System saves as `[language_code]_custom.wav`
5. Voice automatically assigned for future use

### **Example 3: Voice Management**
1. User clicks "üîÑ Refresh Voice Assignments"
2. System re-scans available voices
3. Updates assignments based on current availability
4. User can edit JSON directly in the UI
5. Click "üíæ Save Voice Config" to persist changes
