# ✅ Batch Video Creation Feature Added Successfully

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ **Added Batch Video Creation Feature**
- **New Tab**: Added "🎵 Batch Video Creation" tab to the existing interface
- **Functionality**: Upload 1 video + multiple audio files → get multiple combined videos
- **User-Friendly**: Clear instructions and progress tracking
- **Organized Output**: All videos saved in `batch_dubbed_videos/` folder

### ✅ **Maintained Original Interface**
- **Kept all existing features**: Transcription, Step-by-Step Dubbing, Help
- **No functionality removed**: All original capabilities preserved
- **Same user experience**: Familiar interface with new addition

### ✅ **Removed API Key Security Issues**
- **Removed APIKeyManager**: Eliminated persistent API key storage
- **Memory-only storage**: API keys stored temporarily in memory only
- **Removed hardcoded keys**: Cleaned all placeholder API keys
- **Secure placeholders**: Generic placeholder text instead of real keys

### ✅ **Fixed Technical Issues**
- **Import errors**: Removed references to deleted api_key_manager.py
- **Syntax errors**: Fixed orphaned exception handling
- **Function compatibility**: Updated all API key functions to use memory storage
