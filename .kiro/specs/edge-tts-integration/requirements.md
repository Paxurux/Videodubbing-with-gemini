2. WHEN processing subtitles THEN the system SHALL generate individual audio segments for each subtitle entry
3. WHEN audio segments are generated THEN the system SHALL adjust each segment's duration to match the original subtitle timing
4. WHEN duration adjustment is needed THEN the system SHALL use speed adjustment (0.5x to 2.0x) to fit the target duration
5. WHEN all segments are processed THEN the system SHALL concatenate them into a single audio file
6. WHEN concatenation is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure proper timing alignment with the original video
7. WHEN Edge TTS generation fails for any segment THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining segments

### Requirement 6: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable audio generation even when Edge TTS encounters issues, so that my dubbing process completes successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Edge TTS fails to generate audio for a segment THEN the system SHALL log the specific error
2. WHEN a segment fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to retry the generation once
3. WHEN retry fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to Gemini TTS for that specific segment
4. WHEN fallback to Gemini occurs THEN the system SHALL notify the user which segments used fallback
5. WHEN Edge TTS service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to Gemini TTS entirely
6. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
7. WHEN audio generation produces silent output THEN the system SHALL detect this and attempt fallback

### Requirement 7: Audio Quality and Format Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent audio quality and format regardless of which TTS engine I choose, so that my final output maintains professional standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Edge TTS generates audio THEN the system SHALL convert output to WAV format at 24kHz sample rate
2. WHEN audio format conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL use ffmpeg or pydub for reliable conversion
