# Dubbing Implementation Complete âœ…

## What We've Built

I've successfully implemented a working video dubbing/translation pipeline for your application! Here's what's now available:

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features Implemented

1. **API Key Management**
   - Persistent storage of Gemini API keys
   - Multiple key support for better reliability
   - Key validation and testing functionality

2. **Translation Pipeline**
   - Automatic translation using Gemini AI
   - Custom JSON prompt support for translation instructions
   - Manual translation mode for user-provided translations
   - Format conversion (SRT, CSV to JSON)

3. **Video Processing**
   - Creates videos with translated subtitles
   - Supports multiple subtitle styles
   - Maintains original timing from transcription

4. **User Interface**
   - Clean, intuitive Gradio interface
   - Step-by-step workflow guidance
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Error handling and status updates

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `api_key_manager.py` - Handles API key storage and validation
- `working_dubbing_service.py` - Main translation and video processing service
- `app.py` - Updated with new dubbing UI and functionality
- Test files for validation

#### API Compatibility:
- Uses Google Generative AI v0.3.2 (currently installed)
- Compatible with `gemini-pro` and `gemini-pro-latest` models
- Handles the older API syntax properly

### ðŸŽ¬ User Workflow

1. **Transcription First**: User transcribes their video using the existing ASR functionality
2. **API Key Setup**: User enters and saves their Gemini API keys
3. **Translation Configuration**: User provides translation instructions in JSON format
4. **Processing**: System translates the transcription and creates subtitled video
5. **Download**: User gets the translated video with burned-in subtitles

### ðŸ“‹ How to Use

#### Step 1: Get API Keys
- Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Generate Gemini API keys
- Save them in the application

#### Step 2: Transcribe Video
- Use the "Transcription" tab to transcribe your video
- This creates the timestamped text needed for translation

#### Step 3: Translate and Create Video
- Go to "Dubbing Pipeline" tab
- Upload your video file
- Enter translation prompt like:
```json
{
  "target_language": "Spanish",
  "tone": "casual",
  "style": "conversational",
  "instructions": "Translate naturally for Latin American Spanish speakers"
}
```
- Click "Start Translation Process"
- Download your translated video!

### ðŸš€ What's Working Now

âœ… **API Key Management**: Save, test, and manage multiple Gemini API keys
âœ… **Translation**: Automatic translation using Gemini AI with custom prompts
