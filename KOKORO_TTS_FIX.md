# Kokoro TTS Method Call Fix ‚úÖ

## üêõ Problem
The Kokoro TTS integration was throwing an error:
```
‚ùå Kokoro TTS error: KokoroVoiceParser.get_voice_name_from_display() missing 1 required positional argument: 'language_code'
```

## üîç Root Cause
The method `get_voice_name_from_display()` in `KokoroVoiceParser` has the signature:
```python
def get_voice_name_from_display(self, display_name: str, language_code: str) -> str:
```

But the calls in `app.py` were missing the `language_code` parameter:
```python
# INCORRECT - Missing language_code
voice_name = voice_parser.get_voice_name_from_display(voice_display_name)
voice_name = voice_parser.get_voice_name_from_display(kokoro_voice)
```

## ‚úÖ Solution
Updated both method calls in `app.py` to include the required `language_code` parameter:

### Fix 1: Voice Preview Function
**Location**: `app.py` line ~1658
```python
# BEFORE
voice_name = voice_parser.get_voice_name_from_display(voice_display_name)

# AFTER
voice_name = voice_parser.get_voice_name_from_display(voice_display_name, language_code)
```

### Fix 2: TTS Generation Function
**Location**: `app.py` line ~2138
```python
# BEFORE
voice_name = voice_parser.get_voice_name_from_display(kokoro_voice)

# AFTER
voice_name = voice_parser.get_voice_name_from_display(kokoro_voice, kokoro_language)
```

### Enhanced Error Messages
Also improved error messages to be more descriptive:
```python
# BEFORE
if not voice_name:
    return "‚ùå Invalid voice selection"

# AFTER
if not voice_name:
    return f"‚ùå No Kokoro voice found for language={language_code}, name={voice_display_name}"
```

## üß™ Verification
Created `test_kokoro_fix.py` to verify the fix:
- Tests voice parsing for multiple languages
- Tests service initialization
- Confirms method calls work correctly

## üìÅ Files Modified
- **`app.py`**: Fixed two method calls to include `language_code` parameter
- **`test_kokoro_fix.py`**: New test file to verify the fix

## üéØ Result
- ‚úÖ Kokoro TTS voice preview now works correctly
- ‚úÖ Kokoro TTS generation now works correctly
- ‚úÖ Error messages are more descriptive
- ‚úÖ No changes to Gradio UI layout (preserved as requested)
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality maintained

## üîß Technical Details
The `get_voice_name_from_display()` method needs both parameters because:
1. `display_name`: The human-readable voice name shown in the UI
2. `language_code`: The language context (e.g., "a" for American English) to filter voices

The method filters voices by language first, then matches the display name to get the internal voice name used by the TTS engine.

## ‚úÖ Status
**FIXED** - Kokoro TTS integration now works correctly with proper parameter passing.
