## Manual Mode

Manual mode gives you complete control over translations, perfect for precise content or when automatic translation needs refinement.

### When to Use Manual Mode

- **Precise Control:** When exact wording matters
- **Technical Content:** Specialized terminology or jargon
- **Creative Content:** Maintaining style and voice
- **Quality Assurance:** When automatic translation needs improvement
- **Multiple Languages:** Creating versions in languages not supported by automatic mode

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Prepare Translation

1. **Complete Transcription First:**
   - Use the Transcription tab to get ASR results
   - Review and note any transcription errors

2. **Generate Template:**
   - In Dubbing Pipeline tab, select "Manual" mode
   - Click "Generate Template from ASR"
   - This creates a JSON template with original text and timing

3. **Edit Translation:**
   - Copy the generated template
   - Replace `"text_translated"` fields with your translations
   - Maintain the JSON structure exactly
   - Keep timing information unchanged

#### Step 2: Translation Format

**Required JSON Structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "start": 0.0,
    "end": 3.2,
    "text_translated": "Your translated text here"
  },
  {
    "start": 3.2,
    "end": 6.8,
    "text_translated": "Next translated segment"
  }
]
```

**Important Rules:**
- Each segment must have `start`, `end`, and `text_translated`
- Times must be in seconds (decimal allowed)
- Segments should not overlap
- Text should be natural and speakable

#### Step 3: Input Translation

1. **Paste Your Translation:**
   - Copy your completed JSON translation
   - Paste into the "Manual Translation Input" text area

2. **Validate Format:**
   - Click "Validate Translation"
   - Fix any format errors reported
   - Ensure all required fields are present

3. **Alternative Input Formats:**
   - **SRT Format:** Standard subtitle format
   - **CSV Format:** Spreadsheet-compatible format
   - **Direct JSON:** Copy-paste JSON directly

#### Step 4: Run Manual Pipeline

1. **Configure Voice Settings:**
   - Select appropriate TTS voice for target language
   - Test voice with sample text if available

2. **Run Pipeline:**
   - Click "ðŸš€ Run Pipeline"
   - Monitor progress through TTS and video sync stages
   - Manual mode skips automatic translation

3. **Review and Download:**
   - Check timing and audio quality
   - Download final dubbed video
   - Make adjustments if needed

### Manual Mode Tools

#### Template Generator

**From ASR Results:**
```python
# Generates template with original text and timing
{
  "start": 0.0,
  "end": 2.5,
  "original_text": "Hello, welcome to our video",
  "text_translated": "[TRANSLATE: Hello, welcome to our video]"
}
```

**From Timing Only:**
```python
# Creates empty template with specified timing
{
  "start": 0.0,
  "end": 3.0,
  "text_translated": "[Your translation here]"
}
```

#### Format Converter

**SRT to JSON:**
```srt
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Your translated text here

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,800
Next translated segment
```

**CSV to JSON:**
```csv
start_time,end_time,translated_text
0.0,3.2,"Your translated text here"
3.2,6.8,"Next translated segment"
```

### Manual Mode Best Practices

1. **Translation Quality:**
   - Keep translations natural and conversational
   - Match the original tone and style
   - Consider cultural context and idioms
   - Avoid overly literal translations

2. **Timing Considerations:**
