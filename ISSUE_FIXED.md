# Issue Fixed: Missing `Any` Import

## Problem
The application was failing to start with this error:
```
NameError: name 'Any' is not defined. Did you mean: 'any'?
```

## Root Cause
The `translation.py` file was using the `Any` type hint but didn't import it from the `typing` module.

## Solution Applied
Fixed the import statement in `translation.py`:

**Before:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Tuple
```

**After:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Tuple, Any
```

## Verification
âœ… All dubbing pipeline components now import successfully:
- `pipeline_controller.py` âœ…
- `translation.py` âœ… 
- `tts.py` âœ…
- `manual_mode_utils.py` âœ…

âœ… Basic functionality test passes:
- Google Generative AI library available âœ…
- Pipeline controller imports âœ…
- Manual mode utilities import âœ…
- ManualModeWorkflow creates successfully âœ…

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **FIXED** - The dubbing pipeline should now be available in the Gradio interface.

## Next Steps for Users
1. **Restart the application** in Pinokio
2. **Check the Dubbing Pipeline tab** - it should now be fully functional
3. **Get your Gemini API keys** from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
4. **Start creating dubbed videos!**
